// Computes the DDA for the line and gets ready to draw it.  Puts the

// do the actual drawing.
// 
// Doing Lines Right
// -----------------
// 
// In NT, all lines are given to the device driver in fractional
// coordinates, in a 28.4 fixed point format.  The lower 4 bits are
// fractional for sub-pixel positioning.
// 
// Note that you CANNOT! just round the coordinates to integers
// and pass the results to your favorite integer Bresenham routine!!
// (Unless, of course, you have such a high resolution device that
// nobody will notice -- not likely for a display device.)  The
// fractions give a more accurate rendering of the line -- this is
// important for things like our Bezier curves, which would have 'kinks'
// if the points in its polyline approximation were rounded to integers.
// 
// Unfortunately, for fractional lines there is more setup work to do
// a DDA than for integer lines.  However, the main loop is exactly
// the same (and can be done entirely with 32 bit math).
// 
// If You've Got Hardware That Does Bresenham
// ------------------------------------------
// 
// A lot of hardware limits DDA error terms to 'n' bits.  With fractional
// coordinates, 4 bits are given to the fractional part, letting
// you draw in hardware only those lines that lie entirely in a 2^(n-4)
// by 2^(n-4) pixel space.
// 
// And you still have to correctly draw those lines with coordinates
// outside that space!  Remember that the screen is only a viewport
// onto a 28.4 by 28.4 space -- if any part of the line is visible
// you MUST render it precisely, regardless of where the end points lie.
// So even if you do it in software, somewhere you'll have to have a
// 32 bit DDA routine.
// 
// Our Implementation
// ------------------
// 
// We employ a run length slice algorithm: our DDA calculates the
// number of pixels that are in each row (or 'strip') of pixels.
// 
// We've separated the running of the DDA and the drawing of pixels:
// we run the DDA for several iterations and store the results in
// a 'strip' buffer (which are the lengths of consecutive pixel rows of
// the line), then we crank up a 'strip drawer' that will draw all the
// strips in the buffer.
// 
// We also employ a 'half-flip' to reduce the number of strip
// iterations we need to do in the DDA and strip drawing loops: when a
// (normalized) line's slope is more than 1/2, we do a final flip
// about the line y = (1/2)x.  So now, instead of each strip being
// consecutive horizontal or vertical pixel rows, each strip is composed
// of those pixels aligned in 45 degree rows.  So a line like (0, 0) to
// (128, 128) would generate only one strip.
// 
// We also always draw only left-to-right.
// 
// Style lines may have arbitrary style patterns.  We specially
// optimize the default patterns (and call them 'masked' styles).
// 
// The DDA Derivation
// ------------------
// 
// Here is how I like to think of the DDA calculation.
// 
// We employ Knuth's "diamond rule": rendering a one-pixel-wide line
// can be thought of as dragging a one-pixel-wide by one-pixel-high
// diamond along the true line.  Pixel centers lie on the integer
// coordinates, and so we light any pixel whose center gets covered
// by the "drag" region (John D. Hobby, Journal of the Association
// for Computing Machinery, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1989, pp. 209-229).
// 
// We must define which pixel gets lit when the true line falls
// exactly half-way between two pixels.  In this case, we follow
// the rule: when two pels are equidistant, the upper or left pel
// is illuminated, unless the slope is exactly one, in which case
// the upper or right pel is illuminated.  (So we make the edges
// of the diamond exclusive, except for the top and left vertices,
// which are inclusive, unless we have slope one.)
// 
// This metric decides what pixels should be on any line BEFORE it is
// flipped around for our calculation.  Having a consistent metric
// this way will let our lines blend nicely with our curves.  The
// metric also dictates that we will never have one pixel turned on
// directly above another that's turned on.  We will also never have
// a gap; i.e., there will be exactly one pixel turned on for each
// column between the start and end points.  All that remains to be
// done is to decide how many pixels should be turned on for each row.
// 
// So lines we draw will consist of varying numbers of pixels on
// successive rows, for example:
// 
//       ******
//             *****
//                  ******
//                        *****
// 
// We'll call each set of pixels on a row a "strip".
// 
// (Please remember that our coordinate space has the origin as the
// upper left pixel on the screen; postive y is down and positive x
// is right.)
// 
// Device coordinates are specified as fixed point 28.4 numbers,
// where the first 28 bits are the integer coordinate, and the last
// 4 bits are the fraction.  So coordinates may be thought of as
// having the form (x, y) = (M/F, N/F) where F is the constant scaling
// factor F = 2^4 = 16, and M and N are 32 bit integers.
// 
// Consider the line from (M0/F, N0/F) to (M1/F, N1/F) which runs
// left-to-right and whose slope is in the first octant, and let
// dM = M1 - M0 and dN = N1 - N0.  Then dM >= 0, dN >= 0 and dM >= dN.
// 
// Since the slope of the line is less than 1, the edges of the
// drag region are created by the top and bottom vertices of the
// diamond.  At any given pixel row y of the line, we light those
// pixels whose centers are between the left and right edges.
// 
// Let mL(n) denote the line representing the left edge of the drag
// region.  On pixel row j, the column of the first pixel to be
// lit is
// 
//       iL(j) = ceiling( mL(j * F) / F)
// 
// Since the line's slope is less than one:
// 
//       iL(j) = ceiling( mL([j + 1/2] F) / F )
// 
// Recall the formula for our line:
// 
//       n(m) = (dN / dM) (m - M0) + N0
// 
//       m(n) = (dM / dN) (n - N0) + M0
// 
// Since the line's slope is less than one, the line representing
// the left edge of the drag region is the original line offset
// by 1/2 pixel in the y direction:
// 
//       mL(n) = (dM / dN) (n - F/2 - N0) + M0
// 
// From this we can figure out the column of the first pixel that
// will be lit on row j, being careful of rounding (if the left
// edge lands exactly on an integer point, the pixel at that
// point is not lit because of our rounding convention):
// 
//       iL(j) = floor( mL(j F) / F ) + 1
// 
//             = floor( ((dM / dN) (j F - F/2 - N0) + M0) / F ) + 1
// 
//             = floor( F dM j - F/2 dM - N0 dM + dN M0) / F dN ) + 1
// 
//                      F dM j - [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 ]
//             = floor( ---------------------------------- ) + 1
//                                   F dN
// 
//                      dM j - [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 ] / F
//             = floor( ------------------------------------ ) + 1       (1)
//                                     dN
// 
//             = floor( (dM j + alpha) / dN ) + 1
// 
// where
// 
//       alpha = - [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 ] / F
// 
// We use equation (1) to calculate the DDA: there are iL(j+1) - iL(j)
// pixels in row j.  Because we are always calculating iL(j) for
// integer quantities of j, we note that the only fractional term
// is constant, and so we can 'throw away' the fractional bits of
// alpha:
// 
//       beta = floor( - [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 ] / F )                 (2)
// 
// so
// 
//       iL(j) = floor( (dM j + beta) / dN ) + 1                         (3)
// 
// for integers j.
// 
// Note if iR(j) is the line's rightmost pixel on row j, that
// iR(j) = iL(j + 1) - 1.
// 
// Similarly, rewriting equation (1) as a function of column i,
// we can determine, given column i, on which pixel row j is the line
// lit:
// 
//                       dN i + [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 ] / F
//       j(i) = ceiling( ------------------------------------ ) - 1
//                                       dM
// 
// Floors are easier to compute, so we can rewrite this:
// 
//                     dN i + [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 ] / F + dM - 1/F
//       j(i) = floor( ----------------------------------------------- ) - 1
//                                       dM
// 
//                     dN i + [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 ] / F + dM - 1/F - dM
//            = floor( ---------------------------------------------------- )
//                                       dM
// 
//                     dN i + [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 - 1 ] / F
//            = floor( ---------------------------------------- )
//                                       dM
// 
// We can once again wave our hands and throw away the fractional bits
// of the remainder term:
// 
//       j(i) = floor( (dN i + gamma) / dM )                             (4)
// 
// where
// 
//       gamma = floor( [ dM (N0 + F/2) - dN M0 - 1 ] / F )              (5)
// 
// We now note that
// 
//       beta = -gamma - 1 = ~gamma                                      (6)
// 
// To draw the pixels of the line, we could evaluate (3) on every scan
// line to determine where the strip starts.  Of course, we don't want
// to do that because that would involve a multiply and divide for every
// scan.  So we do everything incrementally.
// 
// We would like to easily compute c , the number of pixels on scan j:
//                                  j
// 
//    c  = iL(j + 1) - iL(j)
//     j
// 
//       = floor((dM (j + 1) + beta) / dN) - floor((dM j + beta) / dN)   (7)
// 
// This may be rewritten as
// 
//    c  = floor(i    + r    / dN) - floor(i  + r  / dN)                 (8)
//     j          j+1    j+1                j    j
// 
// where i , i    are integers and r  < dN, r    < dN.
//        j   j+1                   j        j+1
// 
// Rewriting (7) again:
// 
//    c  = floor(i  + r  / dN + dM / dN) - floor(i  + r  / dN)
//     j          j    j                          j    j
// 
// 
//       = floor((r  + dM) / dN) - floor(r  / dN)
//                 j                      j
// 
// This may be rewritten as
// 
//    c  = dI + floor((r  + dR) / dN) - floor(r  / dN)
//     j                j                      j
// 
// where dI + dR / dN = dM / dN, dI is an integer and dR < dN.
// 
// r  is the remainder (or "error") term in the DDA loop: r  / dN
//  j                                                      j
// is the exact fraction of a pixel at which the strip ends.  To go
// on to the next scan and compute c    we need to know r   .
//                                  j+1                  j+1
// 
// So in the main loop of the DDA:
// 
//    c  = dI + floor((r  + dR) / dN) and r    = (r  + dR) % dN
//     j                j                  j+1     j
// 
// and we know r  < dN, r    < dN, and dR < dN.
//              j        j+1
// 
// We have derived the DDA only for lines in the first octant; to
// handle other octants we do the common trick of flipping the line
// to the first octant by first making the line left-to-right by
// exchanging the end-points, then flipping about the lines y = 0 and
// y = x, as necessary.  We must record the transformation so we can
// undo them later.
// 
// We must also be careful of how the flips affect our rounding.  If
// to get the line to the first octant we flipped about x = 0, we now
// have to be careful to round a y value of 1/2 up instead of down as
// we would for a line originally in the first octant (recall that
// "In the case where two pels are equidistant, the upper or left
// pel is illuminated...").
// 
// To account for this rounding when running the DDA, we shift the line
// (or not) in the y direction by the smallest amount possible.  That
// takes care of rounding for the DDA, but we still have to be careful
// about the rounding when determining the first and last pixels to be
// lit in the line.
// 
// Determining The First And Last Pixels In The Line
// -------------------------------------------------
// 
// Fractional coordinates also make it harder to determine which pixels
// will be the first and last ones in the line.  We've already taken
// the fractional coordinates into account in calculating the DDA, but
// the DDA cannot tell us which are the end pixels because it is quite
// happy to calculate pixels on the line from minus infinity to positive
// infinity.
// 
// The diamond rule determines the start and end pixels.  (Recall that
// the sides are exclusive except for the left and top vertices.)
// This convention can be thought of in another way: there are diamonds
// around the pixels, and wherever the true line crosses a diamond,
// that pel is illuminated.
// 
// Consider a line where we've done the flips to the first octant, and the
// floor of the start coordinates is the origin:
// 
//        +-----------------------> +x
//        |
//        | 0                     1

//        v
//        +y
// 
// If the start of the line lands on the diamond around pixel 0 (shown by
// the '0' region here), pixel 0 is the first pel in the line.  The same
// is true for the other pels.
// 
// A little more work has to be done if the line starts in the
// 'nether-land' between the diamonds (as illustrated by the '*' line):
// the first pel lit is the first diamond crossed by the line (pixel 1 in
// our example).  This calculation is determined by the DDA or slope of
// the line.
// 
// If the line starts exactly half way between two adjacent pixels
// (denoted here by the '?' spots), the first pixel is determined by our
// round-down convention (and is dependent on the flips done to
// normalize the line).
// 
// Last Pel Exclusive
// ------------------
// 
// To eliminate repeatedly lit pels between continuous connected lines,
// we employ a last-pel exclusive convention: if the line ends exactly on
// the diamond around a pel, that pel is not lit.  (This eliminates the
// checks we had in the old code to see if we were re-lighting pels.)
// 
// The Half Flip
// -------------
// 
// To make our run length algorithm more efficient, we employ a "half
// flip".  If after normalizing to the first octant, the slope is more
// than 1/2, we subtract the y coordinate from the x coordinate.  This
// has the effect of reflecting the coordinates through the line of slope
// 1/2.  Note that the diagonal gets mapped into the x-axis after a half
// flip.
// 
// How Many Bits Do We Need, Anyway?
// ---------------------------------
// 
// Note that if the line is visible on your screen, you must light up
// exactly the correct pixels, no matter where in the 28.4 x 28.4 device
// space the end points of the line lie (meaning you must handle 32 bit
// DDAs, you can certainly have optimized cases for lesser DDAs).
// 
// We move the origin to (floor(M0 / F), floor(N0 / F)), so when we
// calculate gamma from (5), we know that 0 <= M0, N0 < F.  And we
// are in the first octant, so dM >= dN.  Then we know that gamma can
// be in the range [(-1/2)dM, (3/2)dM].  The DDI guarantees us that
// valid lines will have dM and dN values at most 31 bits (unsigned)
// of significance.  So gamma requires 33 bits of significance (we store
// this as a 64 bit number for convenience).
// 
// When running through the DDA loop, r  + dR can have a value in the
//                                     j
// range 0 <= r  < 2 dN; thus the result must be a 32 bit unsigned value.
//             j
// 
// Testing Lines
// -------------
// 
// To be NT compliant, a display driver must exactly adhere to GIQ,
// which means that for any given line, the driver must light exactly
// the same pels as does GDI.  This can be tested using the Guiman tool
// provided elsewhere in the DDK, and 'ZTest', which draws random lines
// on the screen and to a bitmap, and compares the results.
// 
// If You've Got Line Hardware
// ---------------------------
// 
// If your hardware already adheres to GIQ, you're all set.  Otherwise
// you'll want to look at the S3 sample code and read the following:
// 
// 1) You'll want to special case integer-only lines, since they require
//    less processing time and are more common (CAD programs will probably
//    only ever give integer lines).  GDI does not provide a flag saying
//    that all lines in a path are integer lines; consequently, you will
//    have to explicitly check every line.
// 
// 2) You are required to correctly draw any line in the 28.4 device
//    space that intersects the viewport.  If you have less than 32 bits
//    of significance in the hardware for the Bresenham terms, extremely
//    long lines would overflow the hardware.  For such (rare) cases, you
//    can fall back to strip-drawing code, of which there is a C version in
//    the S3's lines.cxx (or if your display is a frame buffer, fall back
//    to the engine).
// 
// 3) If you can explicitly set the Bresenham terms in your hardware, you
//    can draw non-integer lines using the hardware.  If your hardware has
//    'n' bits of precision, you can draw GIQ lines that are up to 2^(n-5)
//    pels long (4 bits are required for the fractional part, and one bit is
//    used as a sign bit).  Note that integer lines don't require the 4
//    fractional bits, so if you special case them as in 1), you can do
//    integer lines that are up to 2^(n - 1) pels long.  See the S3's
//    fastline.asm for an example.
