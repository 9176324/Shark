<H2>MultiOS.INF - SAMPLE INF FILE</H2></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #ff0000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">[This is 
preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</SPAN></P>
<H3>SUMMARY</H3>
<P><B><I>MultiOS.inf</I></B> is a sample INF file that illustrates the general 
structure for using a single INF file to install different printer drivers on 
Windows®  Server 2003, Windows®  XP, Windows®  2000, and Windows®  9x (encompassing Windows 98, Windows 98 
Second Edition, and Windows Millennium).</P>

<P>The sample includes specific INF constructs to demonstrate the following 
concepts:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Platform extensions, including consistent usage throughout the INF 
file.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Installation on multiple platforms from one INF file.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Installation of different local language versions of binaries from one INF 
  file.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Review this document carefully, taking careful note of the sample's 
limitations.</P>
<H3>USING THE SAMPLE</H3>
<P>In addition to the contents of this document, the sample INF file contains 
explanatory comments throughout.</P>
<P>Users of this sample INF file will need to add their own information, 
including file names, registry information, and company information in the 
<I>Strings</I> section, and adding additional <I>Strings</I> sections for 
additional local language support and so forth.</P>
<P>The sample INF file includes several <I>DDInstall</I>-related sections that 
are used on more than one Windows platform. These sections are:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>CommonXPAddReg</I>, <I>WinXPCopyDriver</I> and <I>WinXPCopyDlls</I> - 
  common sections for installing on all platforms (x86, ia64, and x64) for Windows XP 
  only.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>WinXPServiceInstallSection</I> and <I>WinXPServiceAddReg</I> - common 
  service installation sections for installing on all platforms (x86, ia64, and x64) 
  for Windows XP only.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>CommonAddReg</I> - common registry section for installing on all 
  supported platforms - Windows 9x/ME, Windows 2000, and Windows 
XP.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When possible, the use of common sections reduces the likelihood of 
introducing errors in the completed INF file, while reducing the size and 
complexity of the INF file as well.</P>
<P>This sample INF file is saved as plain ASCII text (using Windows Notepad with 
the default ANSI encoding). As part of customizing this INF file for installing 
a specific device, you may need to save the INF file with Unicode encoding. 
Unicode allows the INF file writer the flexibility to mix locales that use 
different ANSI codepages. To save any text file with Unicode encoding using 
Windows Notepad, follow these steps:</P>
<LI>Click the Notepad <I>File</I> Menu. 
<LI>Select <I>Save As</I>. 
<LI>Click the <I>Encoding</I> drop-down list, and select the preferred Unicode 
encoding. 
<LI>Click <I>Save</I> to save the file. 
<P>Microsoft provides two useful tools for checking INF file structure and 
syntax:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>ChkINF</I> is a Perl script that checks the structure and syntax of 
  Microsoft® Windows® 2000, Windows® XP and Windows® Server 2003 driver INF files. Results are 
  presented in HTML format, and include a list of the errors and warnings 
  detected in each INF file, with each error and warning shown next to the 
  errant INF file entry. ChkINF is available in this DDK in the 
  <I>tools\chkinf</I> directory.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>Signability</I> is a tool for ensuring that a driver package can be 
  properly signed after it passes Designed for Windows Logo testing. Signability 
  is available for download from the Hardware Compatibility Test Kit Web site at 
  <A 
  href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/testkits">http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/testkits</A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Both of these tools are included in the Hardware Compatibility Test Kits used 
for Designed for Windows Logo testing.</P>
<H4>Suggested Media Layout</H4>
<P>Many devices are distributed with accompanying media (typically a CD) 
containing drivers targeted at multiple local languages and multiple versions of 
Windows. The table below presents one possible structure for organizing such 
media, so that multiple languages can be supported on Windows 9x, Windows NT  
4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.</P></FONT><FONT face=Courier size=2>

<H5>Some notes about this Suggested Media Layout</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Windows 9x does not recognize or handle localized <I>Strings.LanguageID</I> 
  sections, necessitating the use of individual INF files for each supported 
  locale.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Windows 9x does not recognize INF files stored with Unicode encoding, and 
  will ignore any Unicode INF files it might encounter. In this media layout, 
  the INF files targeted at non-Windows 9x platforms are saved with Unicode 
  encoding, so Windows 9x will not see them. If this layout were presented to a 
  Windows 9x user, the user would see a list that included only the Windows 9x 
  INF files, and none of the Unicode INF files targeted at Windows NT 4.0, 
  Windows 2000 or Windows XP or Windows Server 2003.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Because there is no way to differentiate a Windows NT 4.0 INF file from a 
  joint Windows 2000/Windows XP/Windows Server 2003 INF file, a separate INF file should be provided 
  for Windows NT 4.0 support. In the table above, the Windows NT 4.0 INF file is 
  placed in the root directory of the media for easy discovery by Windows NT 4.0 
  users.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Windows NT 4.0 does not recognize driver signatures, so the INF file for 
  Windows NT 4.0 can be unsigned. Even though this file will appear as a valid 
  INF file to Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, if the INF file (MultiOS.inf in the 
  table above) targeted at these versions of Windows is signed, both of these 
  versions of Windows will choose the signed INF file in preference to the 
  unsigned INF file. See the "How Setup Selects Drivers" topic in the Windows 
  DDK Documentation for additional details.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Warnings Generated by the ChkINF Tool</H4>
<P>The ChkINF tool reports zero errors and the following four warnings when 
executed on this sample INF file:</P><FONT color=blue>
<LI><A>Line 95</A>: (W22.1.2208) NT-specific section(s) found. Ignoring general 
section. 
<LI><A>Line 95</A>: (W22.1.2083) Section [DRIVERINSTALL] not referenced 
<LI><A>Line 101</A>: (W22.1.2083) Section [WIN9XADDREG] not referenced 
<LI><A>Line 104</A>: (W22.1.2083) Section [WIN9XCOPYFILES] not referenced 
</FONT><BR>
<P>The first warning, "NT-specific section(s) found. Ignoring general section", 
indicates that this INF file contains installation sections that are decorated 
with platform extensions (<I>.NTx86</I>, <I>.NTia64</I>, and <I>.NTamd64</I>), as well as plain, 
undecorated installation sections ("DriverInstall" for example). Since ChkINF 
detected the decorated sections, it will not check any undecorated 
<I>DDInstall</I> sections it finds.</P>
<P>The other three warnings are related to the first. While ChkINF will not 
check undecorated <I>DDInstall</I> sections, it will report any unreferenced 
sections as an aid to INF developers. These three warnings are simply stating 
that these sections are not referenced anywhere else in the INF file. (Actually, 
the second and third unreferenced sections, "Win9xAddReg" and "Win9xCopyFiles", 
are referenced in the first unreferenced section, "DriverInstall". Due to 
presence of decorated <I>DDInstall</I> sections, ChkINF will not check this 
undecorated <I>DDInstall</I> section, and it and the two sections it references 
are thereby reported as unreferenced.)</P>
<H3>LIMITATIONS</H3>
<P>This INF file is incomplete. Users of this sample will need to add their own 
information, including file names, registry information, and company information 
in the <I>Strings</I> section and so forth.</P>
<P>Note that Windows 9x does not recognize or handle localized 
<I>Strings.LanguageID</I> sections, and so the localization techniques 
exemplified in the sample INF file cannot be used on Windows 9x. See the section 
entitled <I>Suggested Media Layout</I> above for suggestions on handling Windows 
9x. The installation sections for Windows 9x that are present in the INF file 
are included for illustrative purposes only.</P>
<P>As discussed in <I>Warnings Generated by the ChkINF Tool</I> above, the 
ChkINF tool reports zero errors and four warnings when executed on the sample 
INF file. These four warnings represent known issues with the INF file, and can 
be readily explained. Use of the ChkINF tool is strongly recommended when 
writing INF files.</P>
<P>As noted in <I>Using the Sample</I> above, this sample INF file is saved as 
plain ASCII text (saved from Windows Notepad with the default ANSI 
encoding).</P>
