Routine Description:
    Given a RAW report descriptor, this function fills in the DeviceDescription
    block with a linked list of collection descriptors and the corresponding 
    report ID information that is described by the given report descriptor. 
    The memory for the collection information and the ReportID information is
    allocated from PoolType.

Arguments:
   ReportDesc            the raw report descriptor.
   DescLength            the length of the report descriptor.
   PoolType              pool type from which to allocate the linked lists
   DeviceDescription     device description block that will be filled in
                         with the above lists

Return Value:

                                      device.
· STATUS_NO_DATA_DETECTED          -- if there were no top-level collections
                                      in the report descriptor
· STATUS_COULD_NOT_INTERPRET       -- if an error was detected in the report

· STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL          -- if while parsing an item, the function
                                      hits the end of the report descriptor
                                      when it expects more data to exist
· STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES    -- if a memory allocation failed 
· STATUS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION       -- if there is an item in the report 
                                      descriptor that is not recognized 
                                      by the parser
